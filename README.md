# alsa_rnnoise Fork

This repository is a fork of [alsa_rnnoise](https://git.sr.ht/~arsen/alsa_rnnoise), originally developed by Arsen Arsenović. The purpose of this fork is to facilitate personal modifications and enhancements to the alsa_rnnoise project. Specifically, this fork aims to introduce real-time changeable controls to the ALSA plugin for enhanced real-time noise suppression using the RNNoise library.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this fork is to add functionality for real-time adjustable controls to the alsa_rnnoise plugin. This enhancement aims to provide users with the ability to dynamically adjust the noise suppression levels and other parameters without needing to stop or restart the audio stream.
